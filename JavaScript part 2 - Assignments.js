Function Declarations vs. Expressions
The world population is 7900 million people.Create Function Declaration called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the given population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population                                                
To calculate the percentage, divide the given population value by 7900 and then multiply by 100                                                 
Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries your choice, store the results into variables, and log them to the console

Basic Array Operations (Methods)
Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of your choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array into a variable called 'neighbours'                                        
At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array                
Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from the end of the array                                                
If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country â€˜Germanyâ€™, log to the console: 'Probably not a central European country :D'                                         
Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries.To do that, find the index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for 'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.
